 - In log in page I have added two links for login with google and github. And after login user image will show in the navigation bar, when we will hover the image it will show the username as tooltip.
 - After clicking on View Recipes button it will navigate in a new page where I have showed a banner containing chef name, image, short description, likes, number of recipes, years of experience etc. 
 - Each chef contains at least 3 recipes and I have showed those on card for specific chef and show details about recipe process ingredients etc.
